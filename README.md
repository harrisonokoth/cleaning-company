## Installation

No installation required - this is a static website. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## How to Customize

1. **Images**: Replace placeholder images in the `img/` folder
2. **Content**: Edit text directly in the HTML file
3. **Colors**: Modify the CSS variables in the `:root` selector
4. **Form Handling**: Update the form submission JavaScript (currently shows an alert)

## Form Submission

Currently, the form shows a success alert but doesn't actually submit data. To implement real form submission:

1. Set up a form handling service (like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a custom backend)
2. Update the `form` element's `action` attribute
3. Modify the JavaScript form submission handler

## Browser Support

The website supports all modern browsers including:

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Future Improvements

- Add a gallery section showcasing before/after cleaning photos
- Implement a booking system
- Add customer testimonials
- Create a blog section with cleaning tips
- Add multilingual support
